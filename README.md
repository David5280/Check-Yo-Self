# Check-Yo-Self

## Summary

Check-Yo-Self is a final solo project at the Turing School of Software & Design, Module 1, week 6.  This webpage is designed to keep track of tasks that are to be done and checked off by the user.  A title for the to do list is typed in the "task title" input, and individual tasks are entered into the "task item" input and submitted using the black "plus" icon.  Once these two requirments are met, the "make task list" and "clear all" buttons become enabled.  When the "make task list" button is clicked, the title and all of the tasks will appear on a card to the right of the verticle menu.  These cards and the contents save to local storage and will persist upon page refresh.  They can also be permanently deleted from local storage with the delete icon in the bottom right of the card.  These to do list cards can also be marked as "urgent" in the bottom left corner.  Marking a card as urgent will cause the icon to change as well as its status to change, both of which persist upon page refresh.  Each individual task can be checked off which will cause the icon to change, until page refresh where its "checked" status fails to persist.  This project was very useful for imporving on utilizing local storage, maintaining DRY JavaScript & CSS, and recreating a webpage based off a static comp.
